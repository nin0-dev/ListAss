# ListAss
The most annoying virus. It'll restart LSASS in random duration and put itself in startup.

## Removal 

Go to https://listass.nin0dev.com.

Enter the code that was printed on "explode.txt" in desktop.

Once you do that wait for computer to restart. Then you should see a "removed.txt" file and listass will have cleared itself
